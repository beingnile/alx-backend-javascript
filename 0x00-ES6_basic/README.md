# ES6 Basics

JavaScript is a popular language that has been in use for quite some time now as one of the core languages for web development alongside HTML and CSS.  
Its popularity is totally earned as it provides developers a variety of cool features and abilities.  
The language was originally meant for web development but overtime it was adopted for other purposes like server-side scripting and game development.  
Due to a web browser "war" back when JS was invented, The language was submitted to [ECMA International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecma_International) for standardization so that every web vendor could conform.  
And thus `ECMAScript` was born.  
`ECMAScript` , also popularly known as `ES`, is a standard specification of JavaScript.  
`ES6` or also known as `ECMAScript 2015` was the second major revision to JavaScript.  
In this project, I explore the basics of `ES6` and some of the important features in the revision.
